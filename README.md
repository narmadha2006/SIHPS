## Register Number:212223220065
## Name:NARMADHA S
## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea

Establish a comprehensive e-waste management program that integrates community engagement, technology, and sustainability. Begin by setting up convenient collection points in neighborhoods and deploying mobile units to reach remote areas, making it easier for individuals and businesses to dispose of e-waste responsibly. Launch educational campaigns through schools, community centers, and social media to raise awareness about the importance of e-waste recycling, and offer incentives such as discounts and rewards to encourage participation. Implement IoT-enabled tracking systems and GPS technology for real-time monitoring of e-waste collection, transportation, and processing, ensuring efficiency and transparency. Partner with certified recyclers to ensure e-waste is processed in an environmentally friendly manner, recovering valuable materials and safely disposing of hazardous substances. Additionally, use blockchain technology to create an immutable record of the entire process, providing transparency, traceability, and trust among all stakeholders.
